TITLE Calyx of Held Version 4

COMMENT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mechanism to create a "calyx of Held" or an "endbulb of Held". The mechanism
is a multi-site synapse with independent release sites. Each site operates independently
and releases a vesicle upon presynaptic depolarization with a probability 
determined by the history of activity, using the Dittman and Regehr (1998, 2000)
model.

Revised from coh2.mod and coh3.mod.
The Dittman and Regeher (1998, 2000) release model with
facilitation closely fits  Auditory Nerve data from mouse over
a wide range of frequencies.
The model DOES NOT include the postsynaptic receptors or desensitization, since
these should be treated separately (couple XMTR to an AMPA receptor model,
such as the Trussell-Raman model)

Range variables:
nZones: is the number of active zones simulated in this calyx model. Each zone
		can be connected to a separate PSD.
nVesicles: the size of the release pool in the presynaptic terminal
F (0.4): The base release probability
k0 (1/1.75): /s, baseline recovery rate from depletion (slow rate)
kmax (1/0.025): /s, maximal recovery rate from depletion (fast rate)
td (0.05) : time constant for fast calcium-dependent recovery, sec
kd (0.7) : affinity of fast recovery process for calcium sensor
kf (0.5) : affinity of facilitation process
tf (0.01) : rate of facilitation process (slow) seconds
dD (0.02): calcium that drives recovery (ca influx per AP)
dF (0.02): calcium that drives facilitiation

Added latency and variable delay (latstd, latency standard deviation in msec)
around the mean spike time. 4/5/2011 pbm.

Version 4 uses a log-normal distribution to determine release latencies. 
The calcuation is built-in instead of being passed through an array. 
The lognormal distribution describes the individual vesicle release time
course at this synapse as measured by Isaacson and Walmsley, 1996. Note that
they used a gamma distribution in some plots, but the lognormal distribution 
seems to fit their published data at least as well. 
The parameters of the distribution, as well as the release latency,
are controlled by an exponential function whose parameters are initialized at
run time.
