cleftXmtr

This is simple state model that generates "cleft" transmitter, through
the following scheme:

A netreceive block receives the driving event. This forces XV (the vesicle
state) to be set to XMax to mimic the release of a vesicle.
Then:
XV --> XC --> XU
where XV is the vesicle transmitter, XC is the cleft transmitter and
XU is transmitter that has been taken up. The forward rates are finite, and the
reverse rates are 0 (XU is an absorbing state)

The forward rate kv1 mimics simple first-order diffusion across the cleft
The forward rate ku1 mimics simple first-order uptake from the cleft

The concentration XC is available to the program as Xmtr.
XMax is the max cleft concentration of transmitter.

Because vesicle release events at a single presynaptic terminal can be nearly
simultaneous, it is important that this mechanism does not have a refractory
period. We also assume that the uptake mechanism is not saturable.
