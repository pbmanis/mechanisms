TITLE Model of AMPA receptors

    Kinetic model of AMPA receptors
    ===============================

    6-state gating model:
    (scheme 1 from Raman and Trussell, Neuron 9:173-186, 1992)
    2 open states provide dual exponential response.

    This mod file does not include mechanisms for the release and time course
    of transmitter; it is to be used in conjunction with a sepearate mechanism
    to describe the release of transmitter and that provides the concentration
    of transmitter in the synaptic cleft (to be connected to pointer C here).

    Default parameters are set for a miniature EPSC.

    3/15/2005 Modifications:

    1. Added Q10/qfac to allow temperature scaling. All rates in the state model
    are changed by the same factor. A Q10 of 1.5 gives a decay tau (single
    exponential fit using Praxis algorithm in NEURON; using ampa_kinetics.hoc)
    of about 850 usec at 22 deg C and 570 usec at 33 deg C. These are consistent
    with the Raman and Trussell 1992 measurements in avians. The 850 usec is a
    bit fast for an EPSC, and could probably be tuned by adjustment of some of
    the parameters below.

    2. Brought several variables out to global (rather than range) so that we
    can change them - Q10 and gmax in particular. note that gmax is in pS. Only
    local conductance etc. is in specified as RANGE.

    3. Max open probability is less than unity, so a gmax of 2500 yields 100 pA
    at -60 mV. Therefore scaling by mini size must take this into account.

    3/28/2005 Paul B. Manis
    Added rectification to AMPA R. Rectification is controlled by
    polyamine-style block of receptor. See Donevan and Rogawski, 1995; Washburn
    et al., 1997. The equations used here are from Washburn et al. The values
    given in the equation at the break point were determined from EPSCs in 5
    21-d old DBA mice. Blocker = 45 (uM), Kd = 31.32, zd = 1.029. Note that this
    should also reduce the maximal conductance. Mode: if 1, use rectifying; if
    0, use non-rectifying. Default is 1

    This point process uses XMTR as the transmitter concentration to operate on
    the receptor kinetics. XMTR should be provided by another process that
    controls release (e.g., COH calyx of Held, etc). An advantage of this is
    that whatever release process is present, glutamate accumulates in the
    cleft, and can drive desensitization etc.
